### Simulation Results
- **Pre-COVID (Stable Market)**:
  - Expected returns are modest, and downside risk is relatively low (e.g., KOSPI200 Expected Return: 0.0025, Downside Deviation: 0.0953).
- **Post-COVID (Volatile Market)**:
  - Expected returns turn negative (KOSPI200: -0.0038).
  - Downside risk more than doubles compared to Pre-COVID levels (KOSPI200: 0.1752).
- **Issuance Date**:
  - Expected returns recover (KOSPI200: 0.0070).
  - Downside risk decreases (KOSPI200: 0.0876).

### Implications
- **ELS performance is highly dependent on market conditions.**
- In bearish markets, the risk of losses is significantly higher than the potential for returns.
- ELS issued in stable markets generally performs better, with lower risks and higher chances of early redemption.

## 2. Impact of Early Redemption
### Research Findings
- As the **early redemption date approaches**, ELS value tends to **exceed its face value**, indicating higher likelihood of redemption.
- If early redemption fails, the value declines below the face value as maturity nears.
- Early redemption likelihood is a critical determinant of ELS value.

### Simulation Results
- **Average Early Redemption Time**:
  - Pre-COVID: **0.5108 years (about 6 months)**.
  - Post-COVID: **1.1483 years (about 14 months)**.
  - Issuance Date: **0.2209 years (about 2-3 months)**.
- Stable markets result in **higher early redemption probabilities**, while volatile markets delay redemption and increase risk.

### Implications
- **Early redemption heavily depends on market conditions**, with stable markets enabling faster redemption.
- Early redemption probabilities provide a key metric for evaluating ELS value.

## 3. Importance of Risk Management
### Research Findings
- As ELS has a fixed maturity, it is difficult to take flexible actions like cutting losses during a market downturn.
- ELS carries **higher risks than direct investments or indirect products like mutual funds**.
- Investors must sufficiently account for the risk of losses in adverse market conditions.

### Simulation Results
- During Post-COVID periods, downside deviation and volatility significantly increase, raising the likelihood of losses at maturity.
- Pre-COVID and issuance periods show reduced downside risks and higher probabilities of early redemption due to stable market conditions.

### Implications
- **Risk during volatile periods may be underestimated in ELS investments.**
- ELS products are better suited for stable or growth-oriented market environments.
- A robust risk management strategy is essential for addressing losses during market downturns.

## Comprehensive Conclusions
### Alignment Between Simulation Results and Research Findings
1. **Market Conditions Matter**:
   - ELS performance is heavily influenced by market volatility and asset performance.
   - In volatile markets (Post-COVID), risks escalate while early redemption becomes less likely.
2. **Global vs. Regional Risks**:
   - S&P500 demonstrates relative stability, whereas HSCEI and KOSPI200 are highly sensitive to regional market risks.
3. **Issuance Timing**:
   - ELS issued during stable markets offers better returns and higher probabilities of early redemption.
4. **Investor Considerations**:
   - ELS has inherent risks due to fixed maturity, making loss recovery challenging during downturns.
   - Investors need to assess potential losses carefully and prepare strategies for volatile markets.

### Recommendations
- **Portfolio Diversification**:
  - Diversify across multiple assets to reduce volatility and enhance stability.
- **Consider Market Conditions**:
  - ELS performs better when issued during stable or growth-driven markets.
- **Strengthen Risk Management**:
  - Evaluate early redemption probabilities and develop strategies for mitigating risks during bearish markets.
